# spendb.ui

This is the user interface to SpenDB, based on AngularJS. The backend
API of SpenDB is required to properly run this application.

This is a JavaScript project based on Grunt, Bower and all the other
fancy hipster tools. You must have at least Node.js installed before
you can develop this library.
